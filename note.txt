!! what I learned !!

// html

1. required
- The Boolean required attribute, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted.
=> input field must be filled out before submitting the form.

// Javascript

1. Date Objects (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
- Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format.
It encapsulates an integral number that represents milliseconds since the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC.
=> When called as a constructor, returns the current date and time.

2. why convert 'String' when getting hours,months,seconds.
- padStart is for string not number. 'padStart' is used to make '01' not just '1'.
=> In order to use 'padStart()', those should be string after getting time.

3. setInterval() (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval)
- There are many way to call setInterval()
=> setInterval(func, delay) >> a function to be executed every delay milliseconds.
=> code can be replaced function, buy not recommended.

4. preventDefault()
- It prevents the default action of event. the default action of 'submit' is 'refresh' that is why using preventDefault().

5. localStorage(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- localStorage data has no expiration time, the stored data is saved across browser sessions.
- A Storage object which can be used to access the current origin's local storage space.

6. JSON.stringify() (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)
- This static method converts a Javascript value to a JSON string.

7. filter()
- The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array.
- callback -> a function to execute for each element in the array.

8. why using Date.now()
- The Date.now() static method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since the epoch, which is defined as the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC.
=> todo's unique id is required to specify what todo user clicks
   Date.now() returns the different number, that is why using Date.now() to specify todo's id.

9. JSON.parse()
- The JSON.parse() static method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string.
- JSON.parse(text) or JSON.parse(text, reviver)
- text: The string to parse as JSON.
- reviver(key,value): If a function, this prescribes how each value originally produced by parsing is transformed before being returned.
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)

10. Math
- Math.random() : Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.
- Math.floor(x)  : Returns the largest integer less than or equal to x.
- Math.ceil(x)   : Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

11. createElement()
- The document.createElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName.

12. appendChild(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)
- The appendChild() method of the Node interface adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node.

13. navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
- The Geolocation.getCurrentPosition() method is used to get the current position of the device.
- parameters: success, error(optional), options(optional)
-> success: callback function that takes 'GeolocationPosition' object. Then, it is executed when getCurrentPosition() function takes position.
-> error: it is executed when getCurrentPosition function doesn't take position.

14. fetch() 
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
(https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/api_fetch.asp)
(https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-fetch-api/)
- The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses.
- It is used to request data from a server.
- fetch() method returns a Promise, it can use then() and catch() methods.
- When the request completes, the promise will resolve into a Response object.
- .catch handles the error.

//CSS

1. z-index
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)
- The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items.
- auto: The box does not establish a new local stacking context. The stack level of the generated box in the current stacking context is 0.
- integer: it is the stack level of the generated box in the current stacking context.
- -1: negative values to lower the priority

2. ::-webkit-scrollbar
